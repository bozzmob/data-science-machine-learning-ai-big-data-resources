## General Considerations
- Dimensions for comparison (Kevin Markham)
    + Problem type (classification/regression)
    + Results interpretable by you?
    + Easy to explain algorithm to others?
    + Average predictive accuracy
    + Training speed
    + Prediction speed
    + Amount of parameter tuning needed (excluding feature selection)
    + Performs well with small number of observations?
    + Handles lots of irrelevant features well (separates signal from noise)?
    + Automatically learns feature interactions?
    + Gives calibrated probabilities of class membership?
    + Parametric?
    + Features might need scaling?
