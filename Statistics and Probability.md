## Statistics
- Descriptive statistics
    + Summary statistics
        * Location or central tendency
            - Arithmetic mean
            - Median
            - Mode
            - Interquartile mean
        * Spread or statistical dispersion (measures of variability)
            - Standard deviation
            - Variance
            - Minimum and maximum
            - Range
            - Interquartile range
            - Order and rank statistics
            - Absolute deviation
            - Distance standard deviation
